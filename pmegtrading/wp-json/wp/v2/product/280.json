Or use the sweeper to spread materials evenly across a worksite.</p>\n<p>The sweeper attachment is ideal for construction, industrial, and municipal jobs.

When sweeping in reverse the cutting edge must be on the ground and the bristles sweep into the bucket, similar to a broom and dust pan, When sweeping in the forward direction the bristles flick material forward against a rubber flap, go over the top of the bristles and are deposited into the bucket.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Poly Bristles</strong>: Deposit dirt and debris into the sweeper bucket, cleaning a surface with ease and eliminating the need for multiple clean-up attachments. Steel bristles are also available.</li>\n<li><strong>Reversible Cutting Edge</strong>: Helps to cut through caked-on mud and materials. Also, reversible capabilities of the cutting edge allow it to last twice as long.</li>\n<li><strong>Versatility</strong>: Operate the sweeper attachment going in either forward or reverse. Also, use the sweeper to remove debris or to spread materials evenly across a jobsite.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
