    "rendered": "<p>The new DS 100-2 series features a highly efficient aluminium heat exchanger, which minimises performance losses in the refrigeration cycle and at the same time uses less refrigerant than comparable models. The power consumption is also minimal, making running costs exceptionally low. All models in the new series are fitted as standard with a digital controller, featuring practical functions including status display, floating alarm contact and maintenance reminder. In addition to their superb energy efficiency, the new DS-2 models also have impressively low CO2 emissions ratings. They are designed to run on both 50 and 60 Hz (230 V) power supplies and as such can be used throughout the world. For models with a flow capacity of 2.6 m3/min or more, an additional energy saving option is available, further reducing power consumption in part-load operation.</p>\n",
