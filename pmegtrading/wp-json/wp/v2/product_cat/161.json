  "description": "Acid etching sparkles compared to the dull aggregate of sand-blasting and say good-bye to silica dust, worm holes, efflorescence, and other issues. And there is no better way to acid etch than with a Kem-O-Kleen. That\u2019s why there are Kem-O-Kleen systems in place at 70%+ of the nation\u2019s largest architectural precasters, and many other precast, dry-cast, wet cast and FRC locations. Multiple unit installations, strong repeat purchases, and our specialized experience, are further testimony to the product's effectiveness.",
