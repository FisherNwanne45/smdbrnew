The conscious use of the chimney effect ensures perfect\u00a0flow conditions and prevents heat nests when the machine is idle</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 The use of the <strong>latest compressor controls </strong>ensures, with the\u00a0<strong>BOGE control, regulation and monitoring concept</strong>, the automatic selection of the most efficient operating mode as well as intrinsically safe operation at all times of the compressor. Individual fault alarms, permanent current compression temperature and pressure displays, precise and easy pressure settings on the keyboard\u00a0and frost protection for compressors to -10\u00b0C from the factory are just some of the features</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Maintenance friendly</strong></p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 For routine inspection and maintenance the entire inside must be\u00a0easily accessible through large doors and removable sheeting in the cover</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Easy maintenance due to spin-on oil separator cartridge and\u00a0high capacity oil filter; valveless oil circuit</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 This minimises your maintenance and service costs</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Additional features</strong></p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Compressor unit isolated from mechanical vibration</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Motor protection IP 55 with PTC thermistors</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Integrated electrical switch cabinet (IP 54)</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Belt guard for safe operation\u00a0 and protection of the V-belt from dirt ingress</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Constant low oil carry-over in all operating phases due to efficient pre-separation in the integral compressed air-oil separator</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 No condensate in the oil due to thermostatically controlled oil cooler</p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Powder coated surface, light blue, RAL 5012</p>\n",
