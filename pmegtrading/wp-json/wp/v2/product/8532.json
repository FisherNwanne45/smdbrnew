The combination forms a complete modular light weight suspended access system and is a cost effective complement to the range of <strong><em>SKY CLIMBER\u00ae </em></strong>products. The suspension, connection and walk-through stirrups are fabricated from zinc plated steel. All other components are aluminum alloy.</p>\n<p>The Light Weight Stage is the ideal solution for your work environment!</p>\n<h3><u>Light and easy:</u></h3>\n<p>A 12 m platform can be handled and assembled by 2 men. The heaviest component, a 3 m floor section weighs only 22 kg. Fast and easy, the components are designed to assemble a 16 m platform in less than 15 minutes. No tools required as all joints are made by means of connection pins and secured with safety pins.</p>\n<h3><u>Modular:</u></h3>\n<p>Using 1, 2 or 3 m modules, the <strong>LIGHT WEIGHT STAGE </strong>can be assembled to achieve a maximum length of 12 m between suspension centres. Walk-through stirrups can be used with this system as an alternative to the standard suspension stirrups.</p>\n<p>When walk-through stirrups are used, an additional module can be added to each end, making a maximum stage length of 16 m and giving better access to corners of buildings, etc. In addition, the walk-through stirrup assembly in conjunction with two balcony sections of 0,75 m can be used to make up a single hoist cage having a nominal length of 1,5 m maximum.</p>\n<h3><u>Economical:</u></h3>\n<p>The <strong><em>SKY CLIMBER\u00ae </em></strong><strong>LIGHT WEIGHT STAGE </strong>is providing a very cost effective solution to many\u00a0 access problems.</p>\n<h3><u>Safety:</u></h3>\n<p>All Standard configurations are CE (EN1808) approved, meeting and or exceeding European safety regulations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://pmegtrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LIGHT-WEIGHT-STAGE.pdf\" target=\"blank\" class=\"button primary is-primary is-medium\"  >\n    <span>DOWLOAD PRODUCT OVERVIEW</span>\n  </a>\n\n",
