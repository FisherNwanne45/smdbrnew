The trencher is designed with the power and strength to dig in even the toughest, rocky soil types. Use the side-shift feature \u2013 manual or hydraulic, depending on the model \u2013 to dig a trench close to buildings, fences, and other objects. Equip the trencher with different teeth and chain options to maximize trenching capabilities in different soil conditions.</p>\n<p>The easy-to-use trencher attachment is built for improved trench digging and greater reliability on the jobsite. The trencher is the ideal attachment for maintenance crews, municipalities, landscaping contractors, and rental facilities.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<h2>Top Tasks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dig trenches for utility and irrigation systems, power and water lines</li>\n<li>Trench close to buildings, walls, fences, and other objects</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<h2>Choose the Right Model</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Light-to-medium trenching jobs</strong>: The LT112, LT113 and LT 213 deliver 2- to 3-foot dig depths. The LT112 and 113 feature manual side-shift for trenching close to buildings and other objects, while the LT213 may be equipped with optional hydraulic side-shift.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium-to-heavy-duty trenching jobs</strong>: Ideal for utility installation, the LT313 delivers a 3- to 4- foot depth and the LT 414 delivers a 4- to 5-foot dig depth. The LT313 features manual side shift is standard and hydraulic side-shift is available. The LT414 features hydraulic side-shift as standard for trenching close to buildings and other objects. The LT414 is equipped with high-flow performance capabilities to harness the additional hydraulic horsepower capabilities of the machines equipped with high flow hydraulics.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy-duty trenching jobs</strong>: The LT405 delivers a 3- to 5-foot dig depth, and features hydraulic side-shift for trenching close to buildings and other objects. The LT405 is equipped with high-flow performance capabilities to harness the additional hydraulic horsepower capabilities of the machines equipped with high flow hydraulics. Dual augers move spoil away from the trench.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple Chain Styles Available</strong>: All trencher chains are double standard, anti-back flex (ABF) to provide superior constant performance. Look at the options tab to see the multiple different chain configurations offered to suit your needs.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\">\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Auger</strong>: Designed with a large diameter, the auger moves material from the side of the trench, limiting the amount of spoil falling back into the trench.</li>\n<li><strong>Grease Cylinder Tensioning</strong>: Quickly and easily adjust your train to the proper tension.</li>\n<li><strong>Crumber</strong>: Standard on each trencher model to help remove soil from the trench and provide a clean, smooth trench bottom.</li>\n<li><strong>Reverse Rotation</strong>: All trencher models are capable of momentarily reversing the chain direction to minimize stalling.</li>\n<li><strong>Narrow Frame Width</strong>: LT112 \u2013 LT414 are narrow enough to fit into a pickup box to make transportation easy.</li>\n<li><strong>Powerful Operation</strong>: From black dirt to gravel, the powerful operation of the trencher digs through even tough, rocky soil types to build a trench.</li>\n<li><strong>Side-Shift</strong>: Provides attachment flexibility when working next to building or objects, allowing the trencher to achieve optimal productivity in all ground conditions and locations. Manual and hydraulic side-shift available, depending on the model.</li>\n<li><strong>Versatility</strong>: Equip the trencher attachment with several different teeth and chain configurations in order to correctly match soil conditions for maximum digging power.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
