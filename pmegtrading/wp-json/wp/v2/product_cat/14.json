  "description": "Ammann Pneumatic Tyred Rollers provide the kneading and sealing effect that is so critical on jobsites. The tyred rollers perform on both asphalt and aggregates, which of course means the machines must be flexible. They certainly are, with air pressure adjustments made without the operator ever leaving the cab. Ballast packages easily can be added or removed to ensure the most efficient machine and process are provided.",
