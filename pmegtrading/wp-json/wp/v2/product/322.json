The trench cleaner (available with 6 in. and 8 in. wheels only), which is raised and lowered hydraulically, assures a clean trench for installation. Use the hydraulic depth adjustment gauge to deliver a consistent, uniform cut depth. For operating close to curbs and walls, the hydraulic side-shift allows the attachment to shift flush with any nearby object for a close cut.</p>\n<p>Operate with minimal damage to the surrounding jobsite and eliminate the mess of excavation. The wheel saw attachment provides a more precise cut than air or hydraulic hammers and is easier to transport than dedicated machines.</p>\n<p>The wheel saw is the ideal attachment for road repair crews and rental facilities.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<h2>Top Tasks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cut trenches for installing water, gas, electrical, utility, and fiber-optic cable lines</li>\n<li>Prepare pavement for repairs</li>\n<li>Cut through asphalt, rebar, concrete, frozen ground, and wire mesh</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>The hydraulic motor turns the carbide tipped wheel to cut material which then exits through openings on the side of the wheel saw. A hydraulic cylinder controls the depth of cut. A second hydraulic cylinder raises and lowers the trench cleaner to provide a clean bottom trench.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbide-Tipped Bits</strong>: For longer tooth wear, bits are carbide-tipped for maximum uptime protection.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydraulic Depth Adjustment</strong>: Depth gauge provides for uniform depth control while cutting.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydraulic Side-Shift</strong>: For operating close to curbs and walls, the hydraulic side-shift allows the attachment to shift flush with any nearby object.</li>\n<li><strong>Side Cutter Teeth</strong>: Reduce wear to the side of the wheel.</li>\n<li><strong>Skis</strong>: The full length of the skis provides maximum stability and cutting accuracy.</li>\n<li><strong>Spoil Deflectors</strong>: Push milled materials away from the trench, delivering a clean trench for installation.</li>\n<li><strong>Stands</strong>: To improve an operator\u2019s ability to attach and remove the wheel saw, storage stands raise the skis when the attachment is not in use.</li>\n<li><strong>Trench Cleaner</strong>: Hydraulically controlled, the trench cleaner ensures a clean trench is left behind when operating the wheel saw (6- and 8-inch wheels only).</li>\n<li><strong>Hour Meter</strong>: Hours are electronically stored on the attachment and can be read with the deluxe instrumentation panel on Bobcat M-Series loaders to keep track of service intervals and component life.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n",
